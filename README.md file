#### Inspiration for the game: 
- When I was working on the idea of this game, my thought came into my mind if my son 3+ is the target audience how is he able to play?

#### Explains the controls and how to play: 
- It’s a card matching game, one’s flipped the one card and tries to find the other card that matches it and has the same pattern on it and then if match it they stay face-up and the goal is to get all the cards matched. 
- In this game, set a timer and give it some time and it’s going to count down and if it gets to zero the player will lose the game.
-  The game has Score board, going to count the flips, so every time flip a card and it’s going to iterate this flips number, so player wants to get the lowest amount of flips with the highest amount of time to get a good score.

#### List of technologies used to build the game
-	HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
-	CSS (Cascading Style Sheet): Flexbox, CSS-Grid
-	JavaScript: Object oriented design pattern
